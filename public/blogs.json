      "question": "What is a custom hook in React and when should you use one?",

      "question": "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components? Which one is better?",
      "answer": "Controlled components are form elements where React controls the state via props. Uncontrolled components manage their own state using refs. Controlled components are usually preferred because they give you more control over the form data, validation, and handling user input.",

It gives access to properties like pending, success, or error states of a form, making it useful for handling loading spinners, disabling submit buttons, or showing messages based on submission results.",
